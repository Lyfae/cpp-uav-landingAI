# cpp-uav-landingAI

This repository is a part of Cal Poly Pomona's UAV BANSHEE Senior Design Project.

# Summary

The purpose of the drone landing AI is to automatically detect the presence of ArUcO codes on the ground using an on-board camera which will activate the drone's motors to position the device directly above the code, and land itself autonomously. The software is designed to be a closed loop feedback system and fully autonomous.
